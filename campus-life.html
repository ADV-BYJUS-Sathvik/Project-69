            <h5 class="text-success text-capitalize">Founded in 2011</h5>

            <p class="text-muted">Byju's app was developed by Think and Learn Pvt. Ltd, a company which was established by Byju Raveendran, Divya Gokulnath and a group of students in 2011.[7][1][8] Byju, an engineer by profession, was coaching students in mathematics since 2006.[7][9] During the initial days, the company focused on offering online video-based learning programs for the K-12 segment and for competitive exams.[10][11] In 2012, the firm entered Deloitte Technology Fast 50 India and Deloitte Technology Fast 500 Asia Pacific ratings and has been present there ever since.[1][12] In August 2015

                In August 2015, the firm launched Byju's: The Learning App.[13][10] In 2017, they launched Byju's Math App for kids and Byju's Parent Connect app.[14][15] By 2018, it had 15 million users out of which 900,000 were paid users at that time.[16][17] In the same year, Byju's became India's first edtech unicorn.[18] By 2019, 60% of BYJU’S students were from non-metros and rural cities.[19]
                
                In January 2022, the company joined Simplilearn, Unacademy, upGrad, PrepInsta Prime and Vedantu to become one of the founding members of IAMAI's India EdTech Consortium.[20]
                
                In March 2022, it signed a contract with Qatar Investment Authority to establish a new edtech company and an R&D centre in Doha.[21]
                
                In August 2022, Bloomberg News reported that the Ministry of Corporate Affairs sent a letter to Byju's asking them to explain the non-filing of its audited financials for the year ending March 2021. Byju's reasoned that the 17-month delay was due to the challenge of consolidating the accounts of its acquisitions during that year.[22] In spite of the delay, Deloitte gave the company a clean audit.[23] In November 2022, many employees of Byju's came out to speak against the company's unfair treatment. Reportedly, Byju's sacked over 5,000 employees.[24] In April 2023, the Enforcement Directorate announced that it had conducted searches at Byju's offices under the Foreign Exchange Management Act and seized "incriminating" documents.[25]</p>
